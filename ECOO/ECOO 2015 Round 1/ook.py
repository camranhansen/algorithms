this solution probably will not work, but it might:
split it up into sylables.
perhaps we put these sylables in to an array?
the thing is that these sylables can only be taken at face value 
(does that make sense? it probably does not, in hindsight)
No matter.
Hence:
oo
k
g 
gu
ug
m
um
am
So therefore
oogamookoogumook
would be split in to
['oo', :]


Also:
Perhaps: for a list of n length of ook/ug, there are 2^(n-2) + 1 possiblities (when n>? 
Hmm. let's look at this in terms of induction? 
Does 2^(n-2) work?

Ah well. I guess i'l solve this problem at a later day because I am utterly confused.
